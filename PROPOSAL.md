#A* Pathfinding in C++
###Intro
My project proposal is a C++ version of a common pathfinding algorithm called A* star. Using Cinder, this project will be able to display the algorithm's processing in realtime. 

### Reason behind project
Recently, I've been looking into Python projects and I began to look into pathfinding algorithms in python. My hope is to be able to do a similar project in C++. Moreover, working with VexU UIUC Robotics, pathfinding is an important concept to know for autonomous movement in compeition. My interest comes from the difficulty, as well as the application that pathfinding can have.

###Deadlines
Week:
1. **Create A-star algorithm and testing.**  
The main part of the project is creating the pathfinding algorithm. By week one I should be able to construct the logic behind the path finding.  
2. **Develop Cinder framework**  
My cinder feature is being able to show the pathfinding in real-time. I expect to take more time on this because I have less knowledge about cinder compared to C++. So this would likely go into week 3 as well.
   The cinder frame work will include: user ability to change whether they want to see real time or not, and the ability to create walls in order to make pathfinding more extensible.
