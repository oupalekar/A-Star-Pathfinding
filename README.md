This is an A* Pathfinding visualizer made in C++ using the Cinder Library.

Using a 16 x 16 grid, you can visualize how the A* algorithm does its pathfinding across the entire map.
The pathfinding algorithm supports both cardinal directions as well as diagonal ones.

Here's an example of the visual:
